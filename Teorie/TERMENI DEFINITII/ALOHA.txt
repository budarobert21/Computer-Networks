The ALOHA protocol is an OSI layer 2 protocol for LAN networks with broadcast topology.
The first version of the protocol was basic:
* If you have data to send, send the data 
* If the message collides with another transmission, try resending "later"

The difference between Aloha and Ethernet on a shared medium is that Ethernet uses CSMA/CD, 
which broadcasts a jamming signal to notify all computers connected to the channel that a collision occurred, 
forcing computers on the network to reject their current packet or frame.

Pure Aloha had a maximum throughput of about 18.4%. This means that about 81.6% of the total available 
bandwidth was essentially wasted due to losses from packet collisions

An improvement to the original Aloha protocol was Slotted Aloha, which introduced discrete timeslots 
and increased the maximum throughput to 36.8%.

Users send data whenever they want
Two frames on the same channel – collision=> both frames are destroyed
