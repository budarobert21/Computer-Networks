Classful networking is obsolete on the modern Internet. There is no longer any such thing as a class A/B/C network. The correct modern representation for what would have been referred to as a "Class B" prior to 1993 would be "a set of /16 addresses", under the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) system.

the definition of IP addresses was changed to allow three different sizes of the network number field (and the associated rest field), as specified in the table below:

Class- Leading Bit -String Size of Network
Number Bit field* -Size of Rest
Bit field 
Class A     0     8     24 
Class B     10     16     16 
Class C     110     24     8 
Class D (multicast)     1110 not defined not defined 
Class E (reserved)     1111 not defined not defined


The address ranges used for each class are given in the following table, in the standard dotted decimal notation.
Class A 1.0.0.0 127.255.255.255
Class B 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
Class C 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
Class D 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
Class E 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

Some addresses are reserved for special uses:
Class A -  10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
Class B – 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 
Class C – 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

* Classful addressing: 
* inefficient use of address space, address space exhaustion
* e.g., class B net allocated enough addresses for 65K hosts, even if only 2K hosts in that network
