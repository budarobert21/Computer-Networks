Fragmentation/Reassembly

* network links have MTU (max.transfer size) - largest possible link-level frame.
* different link types, different MTUs 
* large IP datagram divided (“fragmented”) within net
* one datagram becomes several datagrams
* “reassembled” only at final destination
* IP header bits used to identify, order related fragments
