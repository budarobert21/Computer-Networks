Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a communications protocol for the transfer of information on the intranet 
and the World Wide Web. Its original purpose was to provide a way to publish and retrieve hypertext pages over 
the Internet.

HTTP defines eight methods (sometimes referred to as "verbs") indicating the desired action to be performed 
on the identified resource.

HEAD 
Asks for the response identical to the one that would correspond to a GET request, but without the response 
body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport 
the entire content. 

GET 
Requests a representation of the specified resource. By far the most common method used on the Web today. 
Should not be used for operations that cause side-effects (using it for actions in web applications is a common 
misuse). See 'safe methods' below. 

POST 
Submits data to be processed (e.g. from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the 
body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or 
both. 

PUT 
Uploads a representation of the specified resource. 

DELETE 
Deletes the specified resource. 

TRACE 
Echoes back the received request, so that a client can see what intermediate servers are adding or changing 
in the request. 

OPTIONS 
Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for specified URI. This can be used to check the functionality 
of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource. 

CONNECT 
Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted 
communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy.[1] 

HTTP servers are supposed to implement at least the GET and HEAD methods and, whenever possible, also the 
OPTIONS method.
