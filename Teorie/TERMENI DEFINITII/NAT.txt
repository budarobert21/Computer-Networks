In computer networking, network address translation (NAT, also known as network masquerading, native address translation or IP masquerading) is a technique of transceiving network traffic through a router that involves re-writing the source and/or destination IP addresses and usually also the TCP/UDP port numbers of IP packets as they pass through. Checksums (both IP and TCP/UDP) must also be rewritten to take account of the changes. Most systems using NAT do so in order to enable multiple hosts on a private network to access the Internet using a single public IP address


* Motivation: local network uses just one IP address as far as outside word is concerned:
* no need to be allocated range of addresses from ISP: - just one IP address is used for all devices
* can change addresses of devices in local network without notifying outside world
* can change ISP without changing addresses of devices in local network
* devices inside local net not explicitly addressable, visible by outside world (a security plus).

* 16-bit port-number field: 
* 60,000 simultaneous connections with a single LAN-side address!
* NAT is controversial:
* routers should only process up to layer 3
* violates end-to-end argument
* NAT possibility must be taken into account by app designers, e.g., P2P applications
* address shortage should instead be solved by IPv6
