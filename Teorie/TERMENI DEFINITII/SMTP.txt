It is very common for email software to use SMTP to send mail and POP3 to receive it, but SMTP can be used to receive mail.

SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol, in which one or more recipients of a message are specified (and in most cases verified to exist) along with the message text and possibly other encoded objects. The message is then transferred to a remote server using a procedure of queries and responses between the client and server.

The SMTP client initiates a TCP connection to server's port 25 (unless overridden by configuration). It is quite easy to test an SMTP server using the telnet program (see below).
SMTP is a "push" protocol that cannot "pull" messages from a remote server on demand. To retrieve messages only on demand, which is the most common requirement on a single-user computer, a mail client must use POP3 or IMAP.

MAIL (MAIL)

   This command is used to initiate a mail transaction in which the mail
   data is delivered to an SMTP server which may, in turn, deliver it to
   one or more mailboxes or pass it on to another system (possibly using
   SMTP).

Syntax:

      "MAIL FROM:" ("<>" / Reverse-Path)
                       [SP Mail-parameters] CRLF
RECIPIENT (RCPT)

   This command is used to identify an individual recipient of the mail
   data; multiple recipients are specified by multiple use of this
   command.
Syntax: RCPT TO:<@jkl.org:userc@d.bar.org>

DATA
354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
   The receiver normally sends a 354 response to DATA, and then treats
   the lines (strings ending in <CRLF> sequences

RESET (RSET)

   This command specifies that the current mail transaction will be
   aborted.
Syntax:
      "RSET" CRLF
VERIFY (VRFY)

   This command asks the receiver to confirm that the argument
   identifies a user or mailbox.
Syntax:
      "VRFY" SP String CRLF
HELP (HELP)

   This command causes the server to send helpful information to the
   client.
"HELP" [ SP String ] CRLF

QUIT (QUIT)

   This command specifies that the receiver MUST send an OK reply, and
   then close the transmission channel.

Syntax:
      "QUIT" CRLF

Extended HELLO (EHLO) or HELLO (HELO)

   These commands are used to identify the SMTP client to the SMTP
   server.  The argument field contains the fully-qualified domain name
   of the SMTP client if one is available.
Syntax:

      ehlo            = "EHLO" SP Domain CRLF
      helo            = "HELO" SP Domain CRLF
